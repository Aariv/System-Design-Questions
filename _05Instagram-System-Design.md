# Functional Requirements
# Posting
1. Users can post photos and videos.
2. Users can caption their posts.
3. Users can tag other users in their posts.
4. Users can add location to their posts.
5. Users can apply filters to their photos.
6. Users can share their posts on other social media platforms.

# Feed
1. Users can view a feed of posts from the users they follow.
2. The feed is sorted chronologically.

# Search
1. Users can search for posts and users.
2. Search results are sorted by relevance.

# User profiles
1. Users can view their profile.
2. Users can edit their profile.
3. Users can follow and unfollow other users.
4. Users can view the profiles of other users.
5. Users can see a list of their followers and following.

# Notifications
1. Users receive notifications when other users like, comment, or tag them in a post.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Scalability
1. The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
2. The system should be able to handle a large amount of data.
3. The system should be highly available.
## Performance
1. The system should provide a fast and responsive user experience.
2. The system should be able to handle high read and write loads.
## Security
1. The system should protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
2. The system should protect against spam and abuse.
3. The system should ensure the privacy of direct messages.
## Architecture
## Load Balancer
1. All incoming requests go through a load balancer that distributes them to multiple servers.
# Application Servers
The application servers handle requests and perform business logic.
The application servers communicate with the database to read and write data.
# Database
The database stores user data, posts, comments, likes, and other metadata.
The database should be able to handle a large amount of data and provide fast read and write performance.
The database should be highly available and have a backup and recovery mechanism.
# Caching
Caching can be used to improve read performance and reduce the load on the database.
Popular posts, user profiles, and search results can be cached.
# Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A CDN can be used to cache and serve static content, such as images and videos, to improve performance and reduce the load on the servers.
# Message Queue
A message queue can be used to handle asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications and processing direct messages.
# Monitoring and Logging
The system should be monitored and logged to detect and diagnose issues.
Metrics such as response time, error rate, and throughput should be monitored.
# Backup and Recovery
The system should have a backup and recovery mechanism to prevent data loss in case of a disaster.
Backups should be stored in a different location than the primary database to prevent data loss in case of a disaster.
# Conclusion
Designing a social media platform like Instagram requires careful consideration of functional and non-functional requirements. The architecture should be scalable, performant, and secure, and it should be able to handle a large user base and massive amounts of data.
